MWD Text-to-Speech is an application that allows people to listen to printed material, read aloud by synthesised voice or human recorded voice. 

The Web Speech API allows you to read computer-based text using digitalised speech.

You can use it simply for reading trough a PDF or as supportive technology to improve reading skills.

For example:
The reading comprehension could be improved by listening at the speech,
While you can work on reading fluency by reading aloud along the text-to-speech voice also, you can maximise the reading rate by increasing the voice’s rate while reading aloud along the text-to-speech app.

The use of this supportive technology is under investigation to see whether it can have a positive impact on people with learning disability.

However, there is not enough information that such web App can have a positive impact on people with earning impairment.
